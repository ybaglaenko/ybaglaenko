# About
Welcome to the github repository for the BaglaenkoLab - until we find a more permanent home or my instituation makes me change the account.

# Projects
Current ongoing projects that have public/private repositories include
1. snpGUIDE: an internal tool we've publically shared for "designing" and ranking protospacers targeting variants of interest with base editors (BE4 or ABE8e). Simply input an rsID and the correspodning sequence will be pulled from Ensembl and all possible guides designed. It looks at reference and alternative alleles to determine what is possible and informs if bystander editing is likely. Examine this table carefully. Some SNPs have multiple alternative alleles and you may not be interested in them all. Batch input is also allowed. The functions and shinyApp files can be downloaded and run locally. Good luck

2. hlaGUIDE: Designing protospacers to HLA alleles is challenging and currently not possible. We wanted to solve this problem and create a webtool capable of this. This repo is currently private but if you're interested - we can collaborate to help you design guides that either ablate or preserve a specfic HLA allele. Example: Ablat B\*27:05 but preserve B\*07:02. It also helps choose cell lines that may express these alleles.

3. Full-length single cell RNA sequencing: This repo is private. We are generating and analysing single cell full length RNAseq data (short read) to discover and validate splice QTLs in primary human cells. These analysis files go from mapping reads to demultiplexing and performing the analysis. This is a work in progress.

4. FL RNAseq + genomic DNA amplicons. This repo is also still private. We are interested in identifying CRISPR editing alongside full length RNA sequencing from single cells. This is a work in progress based on scaling up our foundational CRAFTseq paper.

5. Multiomic analysis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: We are generating and analysing multiomic data from synovium of children with JIA. This private repo contains the analysis files for this work.
